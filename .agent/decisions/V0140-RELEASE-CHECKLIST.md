# V0.14 Release Checklist

Date: 2026-06-10 00:17 WEST
Owner: manager

## Release Rule

Do not tag v0.14 until the code is stable under the current grid-parity,
memory, and validation gates. The release name is secondary; the invariant goal
is a WRF-faithful-enough, GPU-optimized, near compute- and memory-optimal,
scalable GPU rewrite.

## Current Active Lanes

| Lane | State | Gate before release |
|---|---|---|
| Grid-cell parity | Active. Step-1 part2 source-leaves split is closed. WRF `update_phy_ten` explains `T_TENDF` exactly as pre plus active raw `RTHRATEN`/`RTHBLTEN`; `conv_t_tendf_to_moist` closes to roundoff; current JAX dry bundle is still missing equivalent source leaves. | Implement true WRF dry physics source leaves before `_augment_large_step_tendencies`, then rerun Step-1 proof and a short grid-field falsifier. |
| Memory/FP32 Mythos lane | Closed and manager-merged. Accepted commits: `26815feb` MYNN BouLac tiling + shared RK-stage transport velocities, `bc847db2` default-inert FP32 acoustic precision-mode contract, `8f735a56` proofs/roadmaps/closeout. Exact-branch memory preflight is green at 8116 MiB compute peak and 378 s warm-cache. Mixed FP32 R1/R2 remains blocked by the open fp64 dynamics frontier. | Rerun exact-branch memory preflight only on the final candidate branch before long validation. Escalate FP32 implementation to Fable/Mythos only if the fp64 grid-parity frontier closes and GPT cannot directly solve mixed precision. |
| Validation tooling | Grid-Delta Atlas gate is specified in `.agent/decisions/V0140-GRID-DELTA-ATLAS-GATE.md`. GPU runbook exists in `docs/GPU_RUNBOOK.md`. | Atlas produces manifest, summary, markdown report, compact plots, and README-ready dashboard for all common numeric wrfout fields. |
| Switzerland/Gotthard | CPU truth exists. No post-fix GPU run has been accepted. | Post-stabilization GPU-vs-CPU proof with field-level comparison and finite/stability evidence. |
| Powered TOST | Three cases are durable; marathon paused. | Resume only after grid-field divergence is fixed/bounded and memory changes are merged. Interpret together with Grid-Delta Atlas, never alone. |

## Merge Discipline

- Memory/FP32 Mythos changes are already merged after proof review and focused
  regression gates. Future source changes still require proof objects, JSON
  validation, `git diff --check`, and focused regression gates before
  acceptance.
- Keep memory/FP32 semantic changes separate from bit-identical layout fixes in
  commits where possible.
- Do not start long GPU validation from a branch that has unreviewed source
  changes from another worker.

## Final v0.14 Gate Sequence

1. Implement the active `RTHRATEN`/`RTHBLTEN` dry source-leaf fix and rerun the
   strict Step-1 proof.
2. If the source-leaf fix lands, rerun the strict Step-1 and
   short grid-field falsifier before launching longer campaigns.
3. Run exact-branch memory preflight on the final candidate branch.
4. Run Switzerland/Gotthard post-fix GPU-vs-CPU validation.
5. Run Grid-Delta Atlas on the selected paired cases and freeze tolerance
   manifest before claiming equivalence.
6. Resume powered TOST and publish station results together with the atlas.
7. Update README, `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, `PROJECT_PLAN.md`, release notes, and
   proof links.
8. Tag and push v0.14 only after all required gates pass or are honestly
   demoted with a recorded manager decision and independent review.

## Current Do-Not-Run List

- No TOST marathon while Step-1 field divergence is still unresolved.
- No Switzerland GPU campaign before the parity candidate branch is stable.
- No broad FP32/mixed-precision claim from default-inert scaffolding.
- No station-only equivalence claim without all-cell field evidence.
